This project was written when studying Simulating Hamiltonian Dynamics by B. 
Leimkuler and S. Reich, vol. 14 of Cambridge Monographs on Applied and 
Computaional Mathematics, Eds. P. G. Ciarlet, A. Iserles, R. K. Kohn and M. H. 
Wright, Cambridge University Press (Cambridge, 2004).  It was written to answer 
various exercises and examples in the text.  Occasionally a reference to NRiC 
is made in the comments.  This relates to Numerical Recipies in C++ 3rd 
Edition by W. H. Press, S. A. Teukolsky, W. T. Vetterking and B. P. Flannery.
